nebulizer\\ntreatments q.4h.","as well as chest PT.","The nebulizers were\\nincreased to q.1h.","due to the fact that she continued to have\\nlabored breathing.\\n\\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.","A\\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\\nwith tracheomalacia.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\\nmain stem (12 x 25 and

[**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\\nliters, 92% on room air.\\n\\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\\nfollowup within six weeks\\' time status post placement of\\nstents in respiratory failure.\\n\\n2.","Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for a MI.","She\\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.","She was continued on aspirin,\\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\\nregimen.\\n\\n3.","Hypertension: She was maintained on diltiazem

placement.","The Foley catheter was\\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].","She had serial urinalyses, which\\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\\n\\n5.","Hyperglycemia: Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.","This\\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\\n\\n6.","Leukocytosis: Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.","As the steroids\\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\\nwas 15,000.","It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\\npneumonia.\\n\\n7.","For the left lower lobe pneumonia,

lab, where over one liter of fluid was\\ndrained from his pericardial space.","The fluid was sent for gram\\nstain, culture, AFB, [**Doctor First Name **], TB PCR as well as viral studies and\\ncytology.","A pericardial drain was initially left in place, but\\ngiven minimal drainage over 24 hours, was pulled prior to his\\ntransfer to the floor.","The etiology of the pericardial effusion\\nis unknown.","He was followed by Cardiology on the floor and the\\ninitial plan was for a pericardial window, for both tissue and\\nto prevent reaccumulation of fluid.","The patient refused the\\nprocedure at this time.","He will follow up as an outpatient to\\nre-evaluate for the procedure.","The effusion was followed by\\nserial ECHO while the patient was in the hospital.","There was

elevated JVP and increased abdominal\\ndistension at presentation.","Given the patient had been\\nrefractory to diuretic therapy requiring ultrafiltration during\\nher last hospitalization and was oliguric and hyponatremic on\\nadmission, ultrafiltration was initiated rather than diuretic\\ntherapy.","She experienced significant muscle cramping and\\nhypotension while on CVVHD requiring dopamine.","CVVHD was\\ndiscontinued on HD#2 and she was diuresed with IV lasix and\\nmetolazone.","Pressures improved and she was weaned off of\\ndopamine.","It was noted that urine and blood pressure improved\\nwhen the patient was in her native sinus rhythm with\\nasynchronous ventricular pacing.","Therefore the patients\\npacemaker escape rate was lowered to allow for increased

diuresis.\\nOn HD#6 patient underwent placement of a tunneled dialysis\\ncatheter, and on HD#7 she continued HD using the tunneled line\\n(see below).","Lasix and metolazone were discontinued as patient\\nwill be HD dependent.\\n.\\n#Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive on admission in the\\nsetting of volume overload.","Her hypotension was believed to be\\ndue to worsening cardiac output in setting of dilated\\ncardiomyopathy.","She was temporarily on a dopamine gtt, but this\\nwas weaned by HD#2.","In addition, she experienced episodes of\\nhypotension with CVVH with diuresis and antihypertensive\\nmedications, so her antihypertensive medications were held.","On\\ndischarge, her BP was stable.","She was asked to continue to hold\\nher carvedilol and to follow up with her PCP

factor.","She was\\nmaintained on a beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor.","After\\naggressive diuresis, she was weaned off mechanical ventilation\\nquickly.","Diuresis was continued with prn IV Lasix, and

to\\ntrend up again, she was loaded with IV amiodarone and started on\\na drip.","Her rates remained in the 100s to 110s.","She was\\ntransitioned to po amiodarone on the night of [**4-26**].","She\\nexperienced nausea and vomiting on po amiodarone.","She underwent\\nanother cardioversion on [**4-29**] but reverted back to atrial\\nfibrillation the next day.","She was continued on amiodarone but\\nremained in atrial fibrillation.","She went into rapid\\nventricular response in the 150s on [**5-1**], requiring IV diltiazem\\nto bring her rate down.","She was started on po

bleed.","No hip\\nfracture.","+ R humerus fracture.","CT of c-spine showed severe\\nstenosis.","She was initially admitted to the medicine service for\\nworkup of syncope; neurology was consulted for a weak right arm\\nfollowing R humeral fracture and she was found to have a mixed\\ncentral cord and Brown-Sequard syndrome and transferred to the\\nneurology service for closer exam monitoring.","She underwent R\\nhumerus ORIF and C2-C6 laminectomy and fusion on [**2134-3-2**].","A med\\nconsult was obtained on [**2134-3-4**] for persistent hypoxia.","She was\\ngently diuresed, and had serial ABG\\'s which showed persistent\\nhypercarbia.","During the admission, she was also treated with\\nCipro for a UTI.\\n.\\nNeuro: The patient could not recall the events surrounding the\\nfall and sustained a spiral fracture to the right proximal\\nhumerus, displaced, and had bilateral arm weakness and numbness\\ndistally in all 4 extremities.","On exam she initially was found\\nto have evidence of a central cord syndrome with weakness\\naffecting arms more so than legs.","She also had evidence of a\\nbrown sequard given that weakness and proprioception are down on\\nthe right with an upgoing toe, and pin sensation is down on the\\nleft, sensory level of C4\/T3 anteriorly on the left (where the\\ntwo dermatomes meet at the top of the breast).","She was\\ncomplaining of neck pain, and had had trouble voiding so a foley\\nwas placed.\\n.\\nMRI of the C-spine was performed for the likelihood of acute\\nspinal cord injury with above findings.","Read of MRI was: \"\"Bulky\\nossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at C2\/3,\\nC3\/4, and C4\/5 levels, more than the right, causing severe\\nspinal canal stenosis.The cervical cord at those levels is\\ndeformed and compressed, demonstrating intrinsic T2 hyperintense\\nsignal.","There is also a fracture at the inferior endplate of C3\\nanteriorly.\"\"","She was placed in a hard cervical collar and pain\\nwas controlled with morphine and ibuprofen initially.","She was\\nseen by both neurosurgery and orthopedics for the injury as both\\nservices had been alternately covering the spine service in the\\nhospital.","Orthopedics also followed her for the broken right\\nhumerus, and neurosurgery had initially been consulted in the ED\\nwhen a head ct showed the question of a subdural hematoma (later\\nproven to be artifactual).\\n.\\nBoth [**Date Range **] and neurosurgery agreed that it was safest for the\\npatient to hold off on the spine surgery for at least a week to\\nallow cord swelling to heal before operating.","She remained in a\\nhard collar during this time and her exam improved over the next\\nweek; the pinprick sensory level retracted to the T12 region for\\ndays, then finally seemed to vanish altogether; the\\nproprioceptive changes on the right also resolved.","Although the\\nright arm remained weak and flaccid with just [**2-28**] finger flexors\\nand trapezius\/shoulder shrug [**2-28**] (initially thought just limited\\nby pain versus multiple nerve injury), the left arm strength\\nimproved to deltoid [**3-31**], [**Hospital1 **]\/tri both 4+ to 5-\/5, and wrist and\\nfinger extensors 4+\/5; finger flexors were also 4+\/5.","On [**4-9**]: there were no changes in exam.","For neuropathic pain,\\nneurontin had been initiated (patient later requested d\/c to\\nsimplify med regimen).\\n.\\nThe weekend of [**2-27**] on morning rounds, a mild right Horner\\'s\\nsyndrome was noted which had not been picked up before on daily\\nrounds.","This, along with the flaccid arm, was suggestive of\\nroot avulsion on the right (and associated plexopathy).\\nHer neurologic symptoms all gradually resolved during\\nhospitalization.\\n.\\n[**Date Range 1957**]:\\nPt underwent R humerus ORIF and cervical laminectomy (report\\nbelow), however pt post-op, the medicine service was consulted\\nfor hypoxia (pt required 50% shovel mask) and hypercarbia (pCO2\\nin high 50\\'s).","She has a follow up appointment on [**3-18**] with\\n[**Month\/Year (2) **] to evaluate her fracture and decide whether her C-collar\\ncan be removed.\\n.\\nHypoxia\/hypercarbia:\\nPt had hx of severe pulm HTM, likely [**1-28**] PDA.","ABG showed mild\\nCO2 retention, ?","if this was close to her baseline.","Also likely\\nhad component of fluid overload, given recent surgery.","Pt was\\ngently diuresed with IV Lasix.","Narcotics were d\/c\\'d as pt\\nappeared somnolent.","O2 was successfully weaned down to 2L NC (pt\\napparently had been on 2L O2 at home).","CTA on admission was\\nnegative for PE, and the suspicion for PE was fairly low post-op\\ngiven that the pt was not tachycardic and her oxygen requirement\\nimproved.","Therefore, repeat CTA was not done.","She was also\\nnoted to be hypercarbic during admission, but her respiratory\\nstatus remained stable while on the medicine service.\\n.\\nStatus post fall: The original fall was of unclear etiology.","The\\ndifferential included vasovagal syncope versus new onset\\nafib\/atach versus mechanical given loss of consciousness.","Less\\nlikely include myocardial infarction\/ischemia versus pulmonary\\nembolism versus seizure.","Also less likely hypoglycemia given\\ntiming after meal although patinet on glyburide which is renally\\ncleared in setting of increased creatinine.","The patient ruled\\nout for MI by cardiac enzymes, echo showed no obvious severe\\nvalvular disease to explain ?syncopal event, though telemetry\\nshowed periodic tachyarrhythmia ?sinus tach vs afib.","She had no\\nother significant tele events while in the hospital.\\n.\\nElevated WBC and lactate at admission: unclear etiology,\\nafebrile with negative UA and infectious workup at admission.\\nThis cleared on its own.","Later in hospitalization ([**2-27**]) she had\\na UTI treated with course of ciprofloxacin.","Urine cxlood cx, and\\ncath tip cx were sent prior to d\/c to workup somnolence, however\\npt\\'s somnolence cleared and cx\\'s were pending on d\/c.","These\\nshould be followed at

COPD\/Respiratory Distress: End-stage baseline COPD\\n(FEV1 20% predicted and on home O2).","Admitted w likely COPD\\nexacerbation triggered by viral URI.","Nasal complaints and\\nabsence of infiltrate go against a bacterial PNA.","MI and PE also\\nconsidered.","Pt treated with nebulizers, steroids, azithromycin.\\nABG shows chronic respiratory acidosis which appears\\ncompensated.","Pt oxygenated well on O2 by nasal canula, but\\ndeveloped respiratory distress w accessory muscle use, tachypnea\\nand tachycardia, which required MICU transfer on [**2-17**] for\\nincreasing respiratory distress.","He was subsequently intubated\\nthat same night as his respiratory status continued to worsen.\\nHe remained stable on the vent and was extubated without\\ncomplications on [**2-19**].","His respiratory status continued to be\\nstable post-extubation.","He was continued on azithromycin for a\\nthree day course and continued on steroids.","He was then\\ntransferred back to the medical floor the following day after\\nextubation with stable respiratory status.","Followed by Dr\\n[**Last Name (STitle) 2171**].","On the floor his steroid regimen was kept as IV until\\npatient\\'s SBO resolved.","With resolution of SBO patient was\\ntransitioned to PO steroids.","Pt was discharged with a steroid\\ntaper.","His last dose of Prednisone 10mg [**3-6**].\\n.\\nOn the floor his dyspnea continued and he required 4-5 L of\\nnasal O2.","He was evaluated by palliative care after he made the\\ndecision to become DNR\/DNI.","Based on their recommendations he\\nwas switched from ATC morphine to MS contin and ativan for\\ndyspnea related anxiety.","He was noted to have mental status\\nchanges including confusion, somnolence so MS contin was\\ndiscontinued with return to normal mentation.","His respiratory\\ncontinued to improve with decrease in anxiety noted.","Patient\\'s\\npain was well controlled with liquid morphine, fentanyl patch,\\nand tylenol #3 as needed.\\n.\\n# HIV\/AIDS: Patient on HAART with recent decrease in CD4 count\\nto below 200, hence on bactrim ppx.","Followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**].","HAART\\nwas temporarily discontinued in the setting of SBO with nausea\\nand vomiting.","With resolution of SBO, HAART was restarted on\\n[**2152-2-29**].\\n.\\n#Small bowel obstruction: Patient developed acutely worsening\\nabdominal pain on the [**Hospital1 **] associated with nausea and vomiting.\\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a partial SBO.","He was\\nmade NPO and a nasogastric tube was placed.","Patient\\'s nausea,\\nvomiting, and abdominal distention improved steadily.","His NGT\\nwas clamped and eventually discontinued on [**2-28**] with advancement\\nof his diet to a regular diet.","He tolerated that well.\\n.\\n#Pneumonia: Patient was found to have a left lower lobe\\npneumonia incidentally on chest xray evaluating PICC placement.\\nLabs at the time were remarkable for leukocytosis.","He was\\nstarted on Zosyn and vancomycin for presumed Hospital associated\\npneumonia.","Patient\\'s vancomycin was stopped on [**2-27**].","He was\\ncontinued on Zosyn and then transitioned to PO levoquin on [**2-29**]\\nand discharged on this medication to complete an 8 day course of\\nantibiotics with last day of antibiotics to be [**2152-3-4**].\\n.\\n# Hypertension: Normotensive on admission, mild elevation in\\nblood pressures in the setting of respiratory distress.","Patient\\nwas continued on his home dose of doxazosin while in house.\\n.\\n# GERD: Stable.","Continued H2 blocker.\\n.\\n# Anemia: Hematocrit dropped slightly during hospital admission\\nfrom patient\\'s baseline of 36 to 22.","Iron studies demonstrated\\nmost likely anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia\\ncoupled with dilutional effect of IV hydration and daily blood\\ndraws as reasonable explanation of drop in hematocrit.","Patient\\nwas always

chemotherapy cycle and lack of\\nNeulasta use.","Two possible sources of infection existed\\nincluding pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered\\nwhile gardening.","She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and\\ncefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to\\ncover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased\\nostomy output.","When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was\\ndiscontinued.","Blood cultures were sent and a U\/A was not\\nconcerning for infection.","We also sent off galactomannan antigen\\nand beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic\\nfever workup which were negative.","The following day after\\nadmission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was\\nneutropenic.","As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and\\nhe CXR became concerning for an infiltrate.","She was continued on\\nVanc\/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than\\n48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to\\ncomplete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.\\n.\\n# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt\\'s SBP dropped to 70s, not responding\\nto IVF boluses.","She refused central line placement in the ED and\\nperipheral pressors were initiated.","This is most likely related\\nto her underlying infectious process.","She was not administered\\nany medications recently that could be accounting for her\\nhypotension.","Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures\\nare sbp of 90s-100s.","An a-line was obtained which showed higher\\nBP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff.","She\\nwas given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off\\npressors the night of admission to the ICU.","Her cuff and a-line\\npressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line\\nwas discontinued.\\n.\\n# Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +\\nCyclophosphomide.","Most likely this current episode of\\nneutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given\\nduring this cycle of chemo per pt\\'s request, however due to the\\nrapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis

synergy).","Her intrathecal baclofen pump was\\nthought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying\\npump in RUQ).","Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the\\noperation appeared to be without complication.","The following\\nday, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be\\nhypotensive with an SBP of 70.","After spiking a temp, it was\\nthought that she might be septic.","She was given fluids, PRBCs,\\nFFP, and placed on Levophed.","Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm\\nhematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site.","Pt was taken\\nemergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow\\nooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized.","She returned to\\nthe floor and remained hemodynamically stable.","Given 1\\nadditional unit of PRBCs.","Her hct bumped appropriately and\\nremained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course.","Pt\\ndeveloped erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought\\nto be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy.","Amp was d\/c\\'d and replaced briefly\\nwith Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone.","Repeat\\nLP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially\\nresponsive (withdrawing to pain, occ.","opening eyes to name).","CSF\\nanalysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis.","Prior to\\nleaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2.","She was pancultured\\nand all cultures were negative.","A TTE ruled out endocarditis in\\nthe setting of group B strep bacteremia.","On day #12 of\\ngentamycin, pt was changed to vanc\/ceftaz for the completion of\\nher treatment course.\\n.\\n2.","RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen\\npump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to\\nbe bleeding into the RUQ pocket.","She was taken to the OR for\\nemergent evacuation of the hematoma.","On POD #16, pt was noted\\nto have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ.\\nNeurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal\\nultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but\\nfound a new fluid collection.","Surgery was consulted and they\\ndiagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given\\nthat it had no signs of infection.\\n.\\n3.","Pneumonia:\\nTowards the end of the pt\\'s ICU stay, she was evaluated by\\nspeech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the\\npassy-muir valve.","She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent\\nfor culture.","The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram\\nnegative rods (not pseudomonas).","She was started on vancomycin\\nfor MRSA and ceftaz\/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.\\nOnce the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,\\nceftaz was stopped.","Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that\\nwere persistently high.","Vancomycin troughs should be checked\\noften and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.","After the\\npt\\'s swallowing study, she was noted to have increased\\nsecretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was\\nassumed that the pt aspirated.","That day she also spiked a\\ntemperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.\\nVancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course)\\nand Flagyl\\'s course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days).\\n.\\n4.","Supraglottic edema\\nAs above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she\\nfailed a passy-muir valve.","On bronchoscopy it was noted that\\nshe had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and\\nthe vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.","She was\\ntaken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where\\nher granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.\\nENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to\\nevaluate her anatomy.","The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and\\nnarrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.","Ideally, she\\nwill get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the\\npatient has recovered from her acute illnesses.\\n.\\n5.","Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.\\nPt\\'s baseline hct is between 26 and 29

signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e.","incr HR, temp, BP,\\nseizures) once pump was removed.","She continued on Baclofen 20mg\\nqid po with an Ativan taper.","PO baclofen was then tapered to\\n20mg tid.\\n.\\n7.","Mental status\\nAt baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she\\nis alert, oriented, and conversant.","Her decreased responsiveness\\nwas thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to\\nhave resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished\\nreponsiveness persisted.","Repeat LP in the unit suggested a\\nresolving meningitis.","Neurology was following the pt and\\nrecommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ?","of stroke\\nat OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule\\nout subclinical seizures.","An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with\\nsevere encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with\\nmeningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.","An MRI was\\nfinally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating\\nhydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.\\nTowards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and\\neventually returned to her baseline mental

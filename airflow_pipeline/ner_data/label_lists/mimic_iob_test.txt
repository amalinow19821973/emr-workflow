 Admission Date:  [**2196-4-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-4-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2131-5-7**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unresponsiveness

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 64-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, depression, prior
suicide attempt by overdose, recently with exacerbated mood
disorder status post the death of her husband in [**2195-6-2**], now presented after being found unresponsive.  The
patient's daughters found her in the morning of the day of
presentation, unresponsive with empty bottles of Ambien and
Zyprexa at the bedside.  Pill count revealed that the patient
had likely taken 26 Ambien and 12 Zyprexa.  The patient has
been unable to be alone secondary to depression with suicidal
ideation, and has been living with her daughters.  They note
that the patient went to bed at 11 P.M. the night prior to
admission and was found at 11 A.M. unresponsive with
respiratory depression.  The patient had seen her primary
psychiatrist the day before.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was charcoaled,
gastric lavaged, and intubated for airway protection.  She
was hemodynamically stable.  She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was able to open her
eyes, and was moving all four extremities and responsive to
command.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Depression with suicide attempt ten years ago by
overdose.  The patient was hospitalized for two weeks at that
point.  The patient's outpatient psychiatrist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:   Zyprexa 2.5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime,
Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily, Ambien 10 mg by mouth
daily at bedtime, Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily,
nortriptyline 25 mg by mouth daily at bedtime, Klonopin 0.5
to 1 mg daily at bedtime, Biotin and calcium supplementation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with her daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
husband died in [**2196-1-2**].  The patient denied any
tobacco, alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient's temperature was 97.7,
with a blood pressure of 130/65, pulse of 84, respiratory
rate of 14, and oxygen saturation of 100%.  The patient was
ventilated on IMV pressure support with a rate of 14,
pressure support of 10, PEEP of 7.5, volume of 500, and 40%
FIO2.  On general examination, the patient was a very
ill-appearing female, in no apparent distress.  She was
intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed 1 to 2 mm nonreactive pupils.  Neck examination
revealed no jugular venous distention and no bruits.  Cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2, and no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Pulmonary examination
revealed that the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdominal examination revealed a belly that was
soft, nontender, nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema, with 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological examination revealed
a patient that was moving all four extremities, opening eyes
intermittently, withdrawing to pain.  The patient had 2+ deep
tendon reflexes, and downgoing plantar reflexes.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a white blood cell count
of 5.1, hematocrit of 35.9, platelets of 259.  The patient
had a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103,
bicarbonate of 28, BUN of 17, creatinine of 0.6, and glucose
of 102.  The patient's INR was 1.1.  The patient had an ALT
of 19, an AST of 26.  Arterial blood gas was performed
post-intubation and was found to be pH of 7.47, PACO2 of 29,
and PAO2 of 287.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 80, with normal
axis, [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and intervals, and ST elevations in V2 and
Lead I.

Other studies:  Urine toxicology was negative, serum
toxicology was negative.  Urinalysis revealed negative
nitrates, leukocytes, blood, no red blood cells, no white
blood cells, occasional bacteria, and less than one
epithelial cell.

Head CT:  No signs of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 64-year-old female with a
history of hypertension and depression with suicidal ideation
and previous history of overdose attempt, status post likely
overdose on Ambien and Zyprexa, status post intubation and
hemodynamically stable.

1.  Toxicology:  Patient with likely Ambien overdose and
Zyprexa overdose.  Her symptoms of light coma, somnolence and
respiratory compromise were consistent with Ambien overdose.
The patient also had evidence of myosis, which was consistent
with Zyprexa overdose.  The patient had been gastric lavaged,
charcoaled and supported in the Emergency Department.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was supported with
intravenous fluids and gradually weaned on the ventilator to
the point where she was successfully extubated shortly after
arriving to the Intensive Care Unit.

2.  Psychiatric:  Patient with major depression, recently
exacerbated by the loss of her husband, now with a second
overdose attempt in her lifetime.  Likely Zyprexa and Ambien
were the agents responsible.  Multiple attempts were made in
the effort to contact the patient's outpatient psychiatrist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was unable to be reached.  Psychiatry was
consulted, who felt that the patient needed inpatient
evaluation and treatment.  They also recommended
psychotropics be avoided, and that the patient have a
one-to-one sitter.  Social Work and Case Management were
consulted.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Patient was hemodynamically stable with
history of hypertension.  Her antihypertensives were held.
Her electrocardiogram was unremarkable, although there were
no studies for comparison.

4.  Pulmonary:  Patient intubated secondary to decreased
mental status without a primary lung process.
Post-extubation arterial blood gas did not suggest any
obstructive lung process leading to hypercarbia or hypoxemia
from other pulmonary process.  The examination was
unremarkable.  A facile extubation was anticipated, and the
patient was extubated within several hours of arriving in the
Intensive Care Unit.

5.  Psychosocial:  Communication was maintained with the
patient's daughters, who also felt that the patient should
receive inpatient evaluation and treatment.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to an inpatient
psychiatric bed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily,
Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Major depression
2.  Ambien and Zyprexa overdose
3.  Hypertension

 PORTABLE CHEST [**2196-4-10**].

 INDICATION:  Question of retained vascular catheter.

 COMPARISON:  [**2196-4-9**] - 10:41.

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study the previously identified radiopaque
 density in the  the left subclavian region is no longer identified and
 presumably this was an artifact or  outside the patient.  Since the previous
 exam the patient has been extubated.

 The lungs are clear without evidence for focal consolidation, or fluid
 overload.  Heart size is normal.

 IMPRESSION:

 Normal chest.  The concern of the previous radiopaque catheter is dismissed as
 it is no longer present.

 INDICATION: 64 year old woman with loss of consciousness.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the cranial vertex to
 the foramen magnum.

 FINDINGS: There are no intra or extraaxial hyperdensities to suggest
 hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures or mass effect.
 The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable. The parenchymal
 attenuation is normal. The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.

 The osseous structures, soft tissues, and sinuses are unremarkable. The
 mastoid air cells are aerated.

 IMPRESSION: Normal head CT with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Endotracheal tube placement.

 COMPARISON: None

 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position,
 approximately 4cm above the carina.  The NG tube terminates in the body of the
 stomach.  Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 The lungs are clear.  No effusions.  The visualized osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.  There is an approximately 2cm tubular opacity
 which projects over the lateral 3rd and 4th ribs on the left just inferior to
 the clavicle.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in satisfactory position.
 2. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 3. Tubular appearing opacity projecting beneath the left clavicle is of
 uncertain etiology, possibly external to the patient.  Clinical correlation
 advised as to possibility of previous vascular catheter to exclude possibility
 of retained fragment.
